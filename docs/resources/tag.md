# netbox_tag (Resource)

From the [official documentation](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/models/extras/tag/):
> Tags are user-defined labels which can be applied to a variety of objects within NetBox. They can be used to establish dimensions of organization beyond the relationships built into NetBox. For example, you might create a tag to identify a particular ownership or condition across several types of objects.
>
> Each tag has a label, color, and a URL-friendly slug. For example, the slug for a tag named "Dunder Mifflin, Inc." would be dunder-mifflin-inc. The slug is generated automatically and makes tags easier to work with as URL parameters. Each tag can also be assigned a description indicating its purpose.
>
> The assignment of a tag may be limited to a prescribed set of objects. For example, it may be desirable to limit the application of a specific tag to only devices and virtual machines. If no object types are specified, the tag will be assignable to any type of object.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "netbox_tag" "dmz" {
  name      = "DMZ"
  color_hex = "ff00ff"
}

# Example with object types limitation
resource "netbox_tag" "device_only" {
  name         = "Device Only"
  slug         = "device-only"
  color_hex    = "00ff00"
  description  = "Tag that can only be applied to devices"
  object_types = ["dcim.device"]
}

# Example with multiple object types
resource "netbox_tag" "network_equipment" {
  name         = "Network Equipment"
  slug         = "network-equipment"
  color_hex    = "0000ff"
  description  = "Tag for network-related equipment"
  object_types = ["dcim.device", "virtualization.virtualmachine"]
}
```
